### Start with the Vue Native CLI

The Vue Native CLI is used to generate a `Vue Native` app, which is a React Native API wrapper. This means that with Vue Native, you can do anything that could be done with React Native.

The Vue Native CLI generates a simple single page application (SPA) using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and
[vue-native-core](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core).

## Installation Prerequisites

You should have create-react-native-app or react-native-cli installed as a global dependency

```
For React Native ClI => npm install react-native-cli -g
```

```
For CRNA => npm install create-react-native-app -g
```

## Installation:

```
$ npm install -g vue-native-cli
```

Generate [CRNA + Vue App](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core) App

```
$ vue-native init <projectName>
```
