### Start with the Vue Native CLI

The Vue Native CLI is used to generate a `Vue Native` app, which is a React Native API wrapper. This means that with Vue Native, you can do anything that could be done with React Native.

The Vue Native CLI generates a simple single page application (SPA) using [expo-cli](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) and
[vue-native-core](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core).

## Installation Prerequisites

You should have expo-cli or react-native-cli installed as a global dependency

in linux need set corect permission in npm folder
```
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```
```
For React Native ClI => npm install react-native-cli -g
```

```
For CRNA => npm install expo-cli -g
```

## Installation:

```
$ npm install -g vue-native-cli
```

Generate [CRNA + Vue App](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core)

```
$ vue-native init <projectName>
```

## NOTE: 

```
'NetInfo',
  'AsyncStorage',
  'AlertIOS',
  'WebView',
  'ViewPagerAndroid',
  'ListView',
  'SwipeableListView',
  'Slider'
``` 
The above modules are set to be removed from future core react-native. 
Hence these modules can no longer be imported from vue-native.
